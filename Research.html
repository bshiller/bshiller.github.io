        <h6><b>Are Coarse Ratings Fine? Application to Crashworthiness Ratings' Format</b> (with Siqi Liu and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bhoomijaranjan">Bhoomija Ranjan</a>) [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/88mtb8poqhfxwm2/Optimal%20Presentation%20of%20Quality%20Ratings%2C%20September%2020%2C%202020%20Temp%20Website.pdf?dl=0">Paper</a>]</h6>

	<div class="eleven columns"> Many ratings organizations intentionally coarsen ratings before public presentation, for example using a discrete badge rather than a continuous rating.  We investigate the impact of coarsening empirically in the context of automobile crashworthiness ratings.  Specifically, we estimate a random coefficient model of demand for safety under status quo coarse ratings, then simulate the outcomes under a counterfactual scenario with a novel continuous crashworthiness rating system.  We find finer crashworthiness ratings would increase consumer welfare by about $7 billion over five years and alter consumer vehicle choices, thereby reducing fatalities by about 7.4%.  A back of the envelope calculation implies continuous ratings would reduce fatalities in the United States by 1850 annually.  We then explore whether reduced incentives to provide crashworthy vehicles under a continuous rating scheme might offset these benefits.  We conclude that a continuous rating scheme would save lives.</div>

	<div class="one column"></div> 
	<div class="eleven columns"> Digitization has introduced challenges to existing retailers in the form of online competition, leading many brick-and-mortar firms to close their doors in recent years. We study the impacts of such changes in concentration on prices set by the remaining firms. Our empirical setting covers the unexpected shutdown of all US stores of the major toy and baby products retailer Toys R Us. Using various triple-differences strategies, we document rises in average toy prices at Amazon due to the exit of Toys R Us, with large differences in the effects across products. While prices rise unambiguously for the largest toys, prices for small products - arguably those for which Amazon had the largest cost advantage - did not increase and may have even decreased. The results are consistent with simple Hotelling and Salop models that show that firm exit can result in lower prices if the exiting firm has a cost disadvantage. Our findings have important implications for antitrust and competition policy. </div>
