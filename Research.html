          <div class="seven columns"><b>Abstract:</b> Emerging tracking data allow precise predictions of individuals'
            reservation values. However, firms are reluctant to conspicuously implement personalized pricing because of
            concerns about consumer and regulatory reprisals. This paper proposes and applies a method which disguises
            personalized pricing as dynamic pricing. Specifically, a firm can sometimes tailor the ''posted'' price for
            the arriving consumer but privately commits to change price infrequently. Note this personalized pricing
            strategy should arise---possibly unintentionally---through algorithmic pricing when some employed variables
            reflect characteristics of the arriving consumer. I examine outcomes in four contexts: one empirical and
            three hypothetical distributions of consumer valuations. While one may expect this strategy to be most
            profitable for low popularity items, I find, counterintuitively, that this strategy raises profits most for
            medium popularity products. Moreover, typically observable measures of price discrimination suggest it is
            most intense for these products. Furthermore, improvements in the precision of individual-level demand
            estimates raise both the popularity-level where absolute profit gains peak and the range of popularities
            this strategy can be profitably applied to. I conclude that this is an auspicious strategy for online
            platforms, if not already secretly in use.</div>

            the context of automobile safety ratings. First, we construct a novel univariate continuous crashworthiness
            rating from crash test measurements and observed fatality rates. We then estimate a random coefficient model
            of vehicle demand under status quo coarse ratings and simulate outcomes under counterfactual continuous
            ratings. We find that consumers alter vehicle choices, thereby reducing fatalities by 7.4% --- implying 1850
            fewer US fatalities annually. Finally, we explore whether incentives to produce crashworthy vehicles are
            reduced enough to offset benefits of finer information. We conclude that a continuous rating format would
            reduce fatalities.</div>

            consumer friendly by consistently offering low prices. However, recent antitrust concerns about dominant
            online platforms have revived questions about whether Amazon uses its market share to exploit consumers.
            Using the sudden U.S. exit of Toys R Us as a natural experiment, we find that Amazon's prices increased by
            almost 5% in the wake of the exit, with larger increases for popular products most likely stocked by Toys R
            Us. Thus, despite Amazon's long-standing reputation for low prices, it may exploit increases in market power
            as traditional retailers cease operating.</div>

            Impacted sites provide less content over time, providing corroboration for the mechanism. Effects on revenue
            are compounded; ad blocking reduces visits, and remaining visitors blocking ads do not generate revenue. We

          <div class="twelve columns"><b>Abstract:</b> An existing theoretical literature finds that frictionless resale
            markets cannot reduce profits of monopolist producers of perfectly durable goods. This paper starts by
            presenting logical arguments suggesting this finding does not hold for goods consumers tire of with use,
            implying the impact of resale is an empirical question. The empirical impact is then estimated in the market
            for video games, one of many markets in which producers may soon legally prevent resale by distributing
            their products digitally as downloads or streamed rentals. Estimation proceeds in two steps. First, demand
            parameters are estimated using a dynamic discrete choice model in a market with allowed resale, using data
            on new sales and used trade-ins. Then, using these parameter estimates, prices, profits, and consumer
            welfare are simulated under counterfactual environments. When resale is allowed, firms are unable to prevent
            their goods from selling for low prices in later periods. The ability to do so by restricting resale
            outright yields significant profit increases. Renting, however, does not raise profits as much due to a
            revenue extraction problem.</div>

            bundling produces revenue that is not readily attributable to particular pieces of intellectual property,
            creating a revenue division problem. We evaluate several possible solutions using unique song valuation
            survey data. We find the Shapley value, a well‐motivated theoretical solution, is universally incentive
            compatible (all bundle elements fare better inside the bundle than under standalone pricing), but
            revenue‐sharing schemes feasible with readily available consumption data are not. Among feasible schemes,
